## Technical Challenges Faced ##

* Software industry constantly keeps on developing. This means, the libraries and frameworks used in the projects keep getting updated, changed and even depreciated.
* Similarly, importing 'firebase' library to our project caused issues, and debugging it took time. This  issue was tackled by importing it in fragments.
* Since the firebase database is deployed in the test mode, it will require changing to production mode, to be active after a month.
* To tackle these issues in future we came up and applied the following measure:
   	- using cloud based services (firebase) to avoid harm from local corruption
   	- scheduled updation of the tech stack and debugging
